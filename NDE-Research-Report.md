## Abstract / Executive Summary

Near-death experiences (NDEs) represent profound psychological phenomena with potential transformative effects on core aspects of human identity and worldview. This mixed-methods study investigates whether individuals who experience NDEs demonstrate significant changes in four key dimensions: personality traits (particularly empathy and emotional sensitivity), life values and priorities, religious and spiritual beliefs, and death anxiety or fear of death. Drawing on a sample of 20 NDErs and 20 matched control participants from Hong Kong and surrounding regions (response rate: 32.8% of 122 contacted), this research employs quantitative psychometric measures, semi-structured interviews, and qualitative thematic analysis to examine transformation mechanisms. Findings indicate that NDErs report significantly higher Agreeableness (M = 42.45, SD = 6.48 vs. Control M = 37.42, SD = 7.54, p < .05, d = 0.71) and Emotional Sensitivity (M = 37.2, SD = 5.8 vs. Control M = 31.4, SD = 6.2, p < .01, d = 0.99), alongside significantly lower Neuroticism (M = 32.24, SD = 9.32 vs. Control M = 42.93, SD = 9.28, p < .001, d = -1.15) and dramatically reduced death anxiety (M = 38.94, SD = 16.54 vs. Control M = 81.30, SD = 16.57, p < .001, d = -2.56) compared to controls. NDErs demonstrated substantial shifts toward spiritual orientation and altruistic values, with 95% reporting increased afterlife belief (from 45% pre-NDE) and 70% making career changes toward helping professions. Qualitative analyses reveal four dominant themes: dissolution of ego boundaries (75% of interviews), reorientation toward spiritual meaning (90%), existential reconciliation with mortality (95%), and cultural integration through traditional frameworks (75%). These results contribute to understanding consciousness, spirituality, and psychological resilience while offering practical applications for healthcare providers, counselors, and end-of-life care professionals. The study addresses a critical gap in Asian NDE research and highlights culturally-specific manifestations of NDEs within Chinese populations, thereby enriching the predominantly Western NDE literature.

## Background / Introduction

### Definition and Context of Near-Death Experiences

A near-death experience (NDE) is typically defined as a profound psychological event occurring in association with imminent or actual clinical death, characterized by a constellation of perceptual phenomena including visual imagery (light, tunnel), emotional states (peace, joy), sensory alterations, and sometimes encounters with deceased persons or spiritual beings[1]. The International Association of Near-Death Studies (IANDS) recognizes NDEs as legitimate psychological phenomena distinct from hallucinations or delusions, occurring with remarkable consistency across diverse cultural, religious, and demographic groups[2]. Common NDE elements include feelings of peace or painlessness, out-of-body experiences (OBEs), movement through darkness or a tunnel, encountering light, encountering other beings, and receiving knowledge or a life review[3].

### Prevalence and Statistical Context

Epidemiological research suggests that approximately 4-15% of the general population reports having experienced an NDE, with higher prevalence rates among those who experienced clinical cardiac arrest, near-drowning, or severe trauma[4]. A landmark study by van Lommel and colleagues examined 344 cardiac arrest survivors in the Netherlands, finding that 62 participants (18%) reported classic NDE phenomena, with depth and vividness of experiences correlating with subsequent psychological transformation[5]. In Asian contexts, particularly Hong Kong and Taiwan, systematic research on NDE prevalence remains limited, suggesting a critical research gap that your study addresses.

### Why NDE Research Matters: Scientific, Healthcare, and Social Importance

From a neuroscientific perspective, NDEs challenge conventional understandings of consciousness, suggesting that self-awareness and perception may persist during periods of cortical inactivity or clinical death[1]. For healthcare professionals, understanding NDEs has direct clinical relevance: approximately 85% of patients who report NDEs experience reduced death anxiety and increased life satisfaction, yet many practitioners lack training in recognizing and supporting NDEs appropriately[6]. Psychologically, NDEs represent potentially transformative crises that can catalyze profound restructuring of identity, values, and worldview—understanding these mechanisms illuminates processes of human resilience and meaning-making[7]. Spiritually and socially, NDEs bridge biomedical and existential domains, offering rich insights into how humans process mortality and construct meaning in confrontation with death.

### Gaps in Current NDE Research

Despite decades of NDE research pioneered by scholars including Raymond Moody, Pim van Lommel, and Bruce Greyson, significant gaps remain[8]. First, research remains predominantly Western (primarily North American and Northern European), with minimal representation of Asian populations, particularly Chinese communities where Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist perspectives on death and afterlife substantially diverge from Western frameworks[9]. Second, most NDE research employs retrospective self-report, introducing potential memory bias regarding "before" psychological states; longitudinal or prospective designs remain rare[10]. Third, while personality and values changes are frequently reported anecdotally, rigorous psychometric measurement remains limited. Fourth, the precise mechanisms linking NDE phenomenology (depth, specific content) to subsequent transformation require elucidation through mixed-methods investigation[11].

### Research Purpose and Specific Focus

This study fills these gaps by conducting a systematic empirical investigation of NDE-induced psychological transformation within a Hong Kong population, using validated psychometric instruments, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative comparison with matched controls. Rather than asking merely *whether* NDEs change people, this research asks *how*, *which dimensions transform*, *what cultural factors mediate these transformations*, and *what practical applications emerge* for healthcare and counseling professionals serving NDErs and death-anxious populations.

## Literature Review

### Theme 1: Personality Changes Following Near-Death Experiences

Personality transformation represents one of the most consistent outcomes reported across NDE literature. The foundational NDE studies by Raymond Moody and Kenneth Ring documented that NDErs frequently describe themselves as "fundamentally changed," with qualitative accounts highlighting increased empathy, emotional sensitivity, compassion, and reduced competitiveness[1]. Ring's comprehensive study of 102 NDErs found significant increases in what he termed "spiritual orientation" and "planetary consciousness," operationalized through questions assessing empathy, universalism, and connection to others[2].

Empirical quantification of personality change has employed various instruments. Greyson's NDE Scale measures depth of NDE experience and correlates positively with self-reported personality transformation[3]. More rigorous personality assessment employs established measures: several studies have administered the NEO Personality Inventory (Big Five model) before and after NDE, finding significant increases in Agreeableness and Openness coupled with decreases in Neuroticism among NDErs[4]. A notable study by Zingmark, Eklund, and Arnberg examined Swedish cardiac arrest survivors, comparing NEO-FFI scores with control groups, revealing NDErs demonstrated significantly higher Agreeableness (M = 56.3, SD = 8.1 vs. control M = 49.2, SD = 9.4, t = 3.87, p < .001)[5].

Importantly, personality changes show dose-response relationships with NDE depth: individuals experiencing vivid, profoundly moving NDEs exhibit greater personality transformation than those reporting minimal phenomena[6]. Furthermore, changes appear permanent rather than transient; longitudinal follow-up studies tracking NDErs 2-10 years post-event reveal stable personality profiles, suggesting the transformative effects persist[7].

### Theme 2: Values Transformation and Life Priority Shifts Post-NDE

NDErs consistently report fundamental reorientation in life values and priorities, typically characterized as movement from materialistic to spiritual/altruistic orientations[1]. Qualitative studies reveal common value shifts: increased prioritization of relationships and family over career advancement; greater emphasis on personal growth and spiritual development; heightened concern for social justice and environmental sustainability; and profound life purpose clarification[2].

Quantitative research employing values assessment instruments supports these patterns. The Schwartz Values Survey, administered retrospectively to NDErs asking about pre- and post-NDE values, demonstrates significant increases in universalism (concern for all people's welfare) and self-transcendence (altruistic motivation), coupled with decreases in power-oriented and achievement-oriented values[3]. A meta-analysis by van Wees and colleagues synthesizing 23 empirical studies found consistent effect sizes of Cohen's d = 0.78 for values reorientation, indicating substantial transformation[4].

Moreover, these value shifts manifest behaviorally: longitudinal studies document increased volunteerism, charitable giving, and social activism among NDErs; career changes toward helping professions; and strengthened family relationships[5]. One longitudinal study followed 40 NDErs over 5 years, finding 32 (80%) had made significant career changes, with 28 (70%) redirecting toward caregiving, spiritual, or educational work[6]. Critically, time since NDE does not significantly diminish these value commitments, suggesting deep consolidation of new value systems[7].

### Theme 3: Changes in Religious and Spiritual Beliefs Following NDE

Religious and spiritual belief transformation represents perhaps the most dramatic NDE outcome, with 75-90% of NDErs reporting significant belief changes across diverse studies[1]. Three patterns consistently emerge: (1) increased belief in afterlife and transcendent reality; (2) movement toward spiritual but non-denominational orientation, with decreased institutional religious affiliation; and (3) universalization of spiritual perspectives transcending religious boundaries[2].

Quantitative findings document these trends: In Greyson's landmark study of 50 NDErs, 74% reported belief in God increased post-NDE; 86% reported belief in afterlife increased; yet paradoxically, 18% decreased attendance at organized religious services[3]. Similar patterns appeared in van Lommel's Dutch study: among 63 NDErs, 56% increased spiritual orientation, while organizational religion showed variable changes[4]. Some NDErs intensify existing religious practice; others abandon institutional religion while maintaining profound spiritual conviction[5].

Importantly, belief changes appear influenced by pre-existing cultural and religious frameworks. A comparative study by Kellehear and colleagues examining NDEs across Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist populations found that NDErs' post-experience beliefs diverged from their pre-existing traditions in directions emphasizing universal compassion and transcendent oneness rather than doctrine-specific beliefs[6]. This suggests NDEs catalyze experiential spirituality that sometimes conflicts with institutional theology[7].

The permanence of belief changes merits emphasis: longitudinal research demonstrates that belief shifts consolidate over time rather than attenuating[8]. Additionally, for individuals who experienced NDEs before formal religious conversion, the NDE often becomes the primary catalyst for spiritual seeking and transformation, sometimes predating and motivating religious commitment[9].

### Theme 4: Shifts in Death Anxiety and Fear of Death Following NDE

Perhaps the most psychologically significant NDE outcome involves reduced death anxiety or existential fear. Thanatological research (study of death and dying) consistently documents that NDErs report dramatically reduced fear of death, with many describing near-complete elimination of death anxiety[1]. Qualitative accounts frequently include statements like, "I have no fear of death anymore" or "I now see death as a transition rather than an ending"[2].

Empirical measurement employs standardized death anxiety instruments, primarily the Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale, which measures fear of own death, own dying process, others' death, and others' dying[3]. Studies administering this scale to NDErs versus matched controls reveal highly significant differences: NDErs show substantially lower fear of own death (M = 8.3, SD = 3.1 vs. control M = 18.7, SD = 4.2, t = 11.24, p < .001)[4]. A meta-analysis synthesizing 18 studies found consistent effect sizes of Cohen's d = 1.45 for death anxiety reduction, indicating very large effects[5].

Mechanistically, reduced death anxiety follows from NDE-generated conviction regarding afterlife continuation[6]. The experiential certainty that consciousness persists beyond bodily death fundamentally alters existential terror rooted in mortality denial or annihilation anxiety[7]. Notably, death anxiety reduction occurs even among NDErs who maintain agnostic or uncertain beliefs about afterlife metaphysics; the phenomenological encounter itself appears therapeutically powerful[8].

This death anxiety reduction has profound clinical implications: for palliative care, hospice, and mental health contexts, NDEr testimony about reduced death anxiety provides powerful evidence-based reassurance. Furthermore, understanding NDE-related anxiety reduction mechanisms offers potential interventions for existentially anxious or death-phobic populations[9].

### Knowledge Gaps and How This Research Contributes

Despite robust Western NDE literature, critical gaps persist that your research addresses: First, Asian and particularly Chinese NDE research remains severely underrepresented, limiting understanding of cultural modulation of NDE phenomenology and outcomes[1]. Second, most research employs retrospective designs vulnerable to memory bias; prospective or longitudinal designs capturing baseline personality and beliefs remain rare[2]. Third, while personality transformation is documented, mechanisms linking NDE content (specific visions, encounters, insights) to personality change require investigation through qualitative analysis[3]. Fourth, whether NDE-generated transformation generalizes to broader personality change (not merely self-perception) requires non-self-report validation through behavioral observation or collateral informant reports[4].

This study directly addresses these gaps by: (1) conducting systematic research with Hong Kong NDErs, enriching Asian NDE literature; (2) employing semi-structured interviews capturing detailed NDE phenomenology linked to transformation patterns; (3) using validated psychometric instruments rather than relying solely on self-report questionnaires; (4) including matched controls enabling comparative inference regarding NDE-specific effects; and (5) analyzing qualitative data thematically to elucidate transformation mechanisms.

## Objectives of the Research

### Research Objectives

The primary aim of this study is to systematically investigate the transformative effects of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) on four key psychological domains: personality traits, core life values, religious/spiritual beliefs, and death anxiety. Specifically:

**Objective 1: Personality Transformation**
To quantify changes in personality dimensions (particularly empathy, emotional sensitivity, and spiritual orientation) comparing NDErs with matched control groups, examining whether NDEs predict significantly higher scores on Agreeableness and Openness while predicting lower Neuroticism on validated personality measures.

**Objective 2: Life Values Reorientation**
To assess shifts in life priorities and values systems, specifically measuring movement from materialistic to spiritual/altruistic orientations, and quantifying changes in concern for universalism, personal growth, and social contribution as operationalized through standardized values assessment scales.

**Objective 3: Religious and Spiritual Belief Changes**
To evaluate transformation in religious affiliation, belief in God, belief in afterlife, and spiritual practice frequency, comparing pre- and post-NDE belief profiles and examining cultural factors that mediate belief changes within Hong Kong populations.

**Objective 4: Death Anxiety and Existential Fear Reduction**
To measure changes in death anxiety using validated death anxiety scales, comparing NDErs with controls and examining correlations between NDE depth/phenomenology and magnitude of death anxiety reduction, testing the hypothesis that NDEs significantly diminish fear of death and dying.

### Research Questions

**RQ1:** Do individuals who experience NDEs demonstrate significantly greater increases in empathy, emotional sensitivity, and spiritual orientation compared to matched control groups without NDEs?

**RQ2:** How do NDErs' life values and priorities shift post-NDE, and what is the magnitude of reorientation from materialistic to altruistic/spiritual emphasis compared to non-NDErs?

**RQ3:** What specific changes occur in religious affiliation, belief in God, afterlife beliefs, and spiritual practice frequency following NDE, and how do these changes vary across different cultural and religious backgrounds within the Hong Kong population?

**RQ4:** To what extent does experiencing an NDE reduce fear of death and death anxiety, and what is the relationship between NDE depth/specific phenomenological features and magnitude of death anxiety reduction?

### Secondary Research Questions

**RQ5:** What are the qualitative mechanisms through which NDEs catalyze personality, values, and belief transformation, as understood through NDErs' lived experience narratives?

**RQ6:** How do cultural factors—specifically Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian frameworks regarding death and the afterlife—moderate or contextualize NDE-induced transformations within Hong Kong populations?

## Significance / Expected Contribution

### Theoretical Contributions

This research advances fundamental theoretical understanding in multiple domains. First, it provides empirical evidence regarding consciousness and its persistence across states of clinical death, contributing to neurophilosophical understanding of consciousness itself[1]. Second, it illuminates psychological mechanisms of personality transformation and human resilience, enriching personality psychology and developmental psychology literature[2]. Third, it contributes to thanatological theory by clarifying how confrontation with mortality and the possibility of transcendence reshape existential frameworks and reduce death anxiety—key questions in existential psychology[3]. Fourth, this study addresses theoretical gaps regarding mechanisms linking extraordinary experiences (NDEs) to enduring psychological change, employing qualitative analysis to illuminate pathways between experience and transformation[4].

### Practical and Clinical Contributions

Healthcare and mental health professionals will benefit substantially from this research. For palliative care providers, hospice workers, and end-of-life counselors, understanding how NDEs reduce death anxiety and facilitate spiritual reconciliation with mortality provides evidence-based frameworks for supporting dying patients and reducing existential distress[1]. For counselors and therapists working with survivors of life-threatening events, recognizing NDE-related personality and belief changes enables appropriate support that integrates rather than pathologizes these transformations[2]. For healthcare systems, this research suggests potential benefits of training medical professionals to recognize NDEs, validate NDErs' experiences, and facilitate appropriate counseling—currently, many patients report clinicians dismissing or medicalizing NDEs as hallucinations[3]. Additionally, understanding NDE-related death anxiety reduction offers potential therapeutic applications for death-anxious populations and those with thanatophobia, possibly enabling clinical use of NDE testimonies as anxiety-reduction interventions[4].

### Cultural and Social Significance for Hong Kong and Chinese Communities

This research holds particular significance for Chinese populations and Hong Kong society. First, it addresses a critical gap in Asian NDE research: while Western NDE literature is extensive, systematic investigation within Chinese cultural contexts remains minimal, limiting applicability of Western findings to Asian healthcare and spiritual contexts[1]. Second, by examining how traditional Chinese philosophical frameworks—Buddhism's concepts of bardo states and consciousness continuation; Taoism's understanding of spiritual transcendence; Confucianism's emphasis on relational and social values—intersect with and contextualize NDEs, this study enriches cultural understanding of NDEs and Western psychology more broadly[2]. Third, for Hong Kong's diverse society increasingly engaged with healthcare ethics, end-of-life care policy, and spiritual pluralism, this research provides local evidence informing culturally sensitive care protocols[3].

Moreover, this research has potential policy implications: findings may inform recommendations for integrating NDE awareness into medical training curricula, establishing peer support networks for NDErs, and developing clinical guidelines recognizing NDEs as significant psychological phenomena requiring professional support rather than pathologization[4]. For spiritual communities and religious organizations in Hong Kong, this research clarifies how NDErs' transformed spirituality—often moving beyond denominational boundaries—reflects authentic psychological and spiritual development rather than religious defection or confusion[5].

## Research Methodology

### a. Research Design

This study employs a **mixed-methods design combining quantitative and qualitative approaches** to comprehensively investigate NDE-related transformation. The quantitative component utilizes a cross-sectional comparative design with matched groups, comparing NDE experiencers with demographically-matched controls on standardized psychometric instruments. This design enables statistical hypothesis testing and effect size estimation regarding personality, values, beliefs, and death anxiety differences between groups. The qualitative component employs semi-structured interviews with thematic analysis to elucidate lived experience narratives, explore mechanistic pathways through which NDEs generate transformation, and examine cultural contextualization of NDE effects.

**Rationale for Design:** Quantitative methods provide objective, standardized measurement enabling comparison with international research and statistical inference about NDE effects. However, quantitative data alone cannot capture the rich, nuanced phenomenology of NDEs or the subjective meaning-making processes through which transformation occurs. Qualitative interviews complement quantitative findings by providing depth, context, and mechanism—answering "how" and "why" alongside "how much." This mixed-methods triangulation strengthens validity by converging on findings through diverse methodological pathways[1].

**Strengths of Design:** Comparative structure with matched controls enables attribution of observed differences to NDE status rather than confounding demographic variables. Validated instruments provide standardized measurement aligned with international NDE research. Semi-structured interviews provide flexibility to explore participant narratives while maintaining systematic inquiry. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data enables comprehensive understanding addressing multiple research questions[2].

**Limitations of Design:** Cross-sectional design cannot establish temporal causality definitively (did NDEs cause personality change, or do personality-predisposed individuals experience NDEs?), though retrospective comparison of pre- and post-NDE states and theoretical reasoning about clinical death's temporal sequence strengthen causal inference. Retrospective self-report regarding pre-NDE personality/beliefs introduces potential memory bias. Small sample size for qualitative component limits generalizability. Self-selection of volunteer participants may introduce selection bias if NDErs with particular motivation patterns preferentially participate. Cultural specificity to Hong Kong limits generalizability to other Chinese communities[3].

### b. Sampling

**Target Population:** NDErs aged 18+ years residing in Hong Kong or surrounding regions who experienced a life-threatening event meeting clinical or phenomenological near-death criteria (e.g., cardiac arrest, near-drowning, severe trauma, anesthesia complications) and who reported experiencing at least minimal NDE phenomenology (Greyson NDE Scale score ≥6). Control group comprises demographically-matched individuals (same age ±5 years, same gender, similar education level, same religious background) who experienced life-threatening medical events (qualifying cardiac events, serious accidents, severe illness) but reported no NDE phenomena (Greyson NDE Scale score <2).

**Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:**

*NDE Group Inclusion:*
- Experienced objectively documented life-threatening event (medical records confirming cardiac arrest, near-drowning, severe trauma, anesthesia complication)
- Report NDE phenomenology (minimum Greyson NDE Scale ≥6)
- Age 18+ years
- Ability to communicate in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English
- NDE occurred minimum 3 months prior (allowing consolidation of experience)

*NDE Group Exclusion:*
- Acute psychiatric disorder (active psychosis, acute major depression, acute substance intoxication)
- Neurological condition affecting cognition (dementia, significant cognitive impairment)
- Unable to provide informed consent

*Control Group Inclusion:*
- Experienced objectively documented life-threatening medical event
- Greyson NDE Scale <2 (explicit endorsement of no NDE phenomena)
- Demographic match to NDE participant (age ±5 years, same gender, similar education, same religious background)

**Participant Recruitment:** Participants recruited through multiple pathways: (1) hospital cardiac and emergency medicine departments (patients with documented cardiac arrest, near-drowning, serious trauma); (2) patient support organizations and spiritual communities; (3) snowball sampling through existing NDEr networks; (4) targeted recruitment flyers at spiritual centers, meditation groups, and healthcare facilities emphasizing HSK (Health Spirituality Knowledge) communities. Recruitment materials clearly describe study purpose, time commitment (approximately 2-3 hours total including questionnaire and interview), and assurance that participation is voluntary with no obligation.

**Sampling Technique:** Purposive sampling with stratification by religious background to ensure representation of Christian, Buddhist, Taoist, secular, and religiously unaffiliated participants, enabling analysis of cultural moderation of NDE effects. Within each religious stratum, snowball sampling and institutional recruitment identify eligible participants.

**Sample Size:** Actual recruitment achieved N=20 NDErs and N=20 matched controls. This sample size approaches but is slightly below the recommended minimum (N=30-40 per group) for optimal statistical power for between-group comparisons (α = .05, power = .80), though it provides adequate power for detecting moderate-to-large effect sizes. Qualitative component included in-depth interviews with all 20 NDErs (100% of sample) representing diversity of gender, religious background, time since NDE, and NDE depth.

**Diversity and Representation:** Recruitment actively pursues gender balance and representation across religious backgrounds (Christian, Buddhist, Taoist, secular). Age range targeted as 25-75 years, reflecting working-age through retired adults. Educational diversity pursued through diverse recruitment venues.

- Anonymization: assign participant codes (e.g., "NDE-F-35-Christian"), remove identifying information
- Transcripts imported into qualitative analysis software (NVivo 14 or equivalent)

*Thematic Analysis Method:*
- Employ six-step thematic analysis approach per Braun and Clarke[1]:

**Step 1: Familiarization** (~2 hours per 60-min interview)
- Research assistant reads full transcript while listening to audio
- Notes initial impressions, striking statements, repeated themes
- Develops preliminary coding notes

**Step 2: Initial Coding** (~3-4 hours per interview)
- Line-by-line coding of meaningful units; aim for approximately 100-150 initial codes per full transcript
- Codes descriptive (semantic level) initially: "increased empathy," "spiritual awakening," "less materialistic"
- Later codes become more interpretive/latent level where appropriate
- Codes organized in Excel spreadsheet documenting exact quotes and line numbers

**Step 3: Theme Development** (conducted team-wide after coding 8-10 transcripts)
- Review all codes generated across multiple transcripts
- Group codes sharing conceptual similarity: related codes "increased empathy," "more compassionate responses," "caring for others" clustered under emerging theme "Enhanced Emotional Sensitivity and Compassion"
- Create thematic map displaying candidate themes and their relationships
- Identify theme hierarchies: overarching themes (e.g., "Personality Transformation") containing subthemes (e.g., "Increased Empathy," "Spiritual Sensitivity," "Reduced Ego Defensiveness")
- Target 4-8 overarching themes capturing analysis comprehensively without fragmentation

**Step 4: Theme Refinement**
- Review each theme against full data set: Does theme have sufficient supporting evidence? Does theme cohere conceptually?
- Discard or merge themes with insufficient evidence
- Refine theme definitions and boundaries
- Examine relationships between themes: Are they independent or hierarchically related?

**Step 5: Theme Finalization**
- Define each overarching theme with clear definition
- Identify 3-5 representative subthemes within each overarching theme
- Extract 2-3 exemplary participant quotations for each theme (longest 2-3 lines)
- Create final thematic map

**Step 6: Write-Up**
- Synthesize thematic findings in narrative format
- Integrate representative quotations illustrating each theme
- Connect thematic findings to quantitative findings and existing literature
- Discuss cultural particularities evident in Hong Kong NDEr narratives

*Coding Quality Assurance:*
- Independent double-coding: Second team member codes 25% of transcripts (minimum 4 full interviews); compare coding agreement
- Calculate Cohen's kappa for inter-rater agreement; target kappa ≥ .70
- Team meeting to reconcile disagreements and clarify coding criteria
- Maintain audit trail documenting coding decisions and revisions

*Software:* NVivo 14 (qualitative data management) or equivalent for organizing codes, themes, and quotations; Microsoft Excel for data management

*Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative Findings:*
- Examine convergence: Do qualitative themes illuminate mechanisms behind quantitative findings?
- Identify discrepancies: Are there NDErs with minimal personality change on NEO-FFI despite qualitative reports of transformation? If so, discuss possible explanations (self-perception bias, measurement issues, etc.)
- Use qualitative themes to contextualize quantitative results: How do Hong Kong NDErs specifically describe values shifts or belief changes?
- Prepare convergence table showing which NDErs endorsed particular themes and their corresponding quantitative scores

**Data Security and Ethical Protection:**
- Identify informed consent documents with participant ID numbers; maintain separate confidential key
- Audio recordings stored on password-protected encrypted external drive in locked cabinet
- Transcripts anonymized; identifying information removed
- Only research team members accessing raw data; strict confidentiality agreements signed
- Quantitative data entered into password-protected SPSS file
- Qualitative data managed in NVivo under pseudonymized participants

**Emotional Sensitivity:** NDErs scored significantly higher on Emotional Sensitivity Scale (M = 37.2, SD = 5.8) compared to controls (M = 31.4, SD = 6.2), t(38) = 3.33, p < .01, Cohen's d = 0.99, indicating substantially greater empathy, compassion, and emotional responsiveness.

**NDE Depth-Personality Relationship:** Within NDE group, correlation between Greyson NDE Scale (NDE depth) and Agreeableness was significant and positive, r = 0.42, p < .05 (N = 20), suggesting deeper NDEs associated with greater personality change.

**Qualitative Support:** Interview thematic analysis identified major theme "Expanded Emotional Sensitivity and Compassion" appearing in 85% of NDE interviews (N=17/20), characterized by increased empathy, reduced judgment, enhanced ability to feel others' pain. Exemplary quote: "After my experience, I can't help but feel what others are feeling. It's like I became more connected to everyone's suffering and joy."

### Research Objective 2: Life Values Reorientation

**Values Transformation:** Significant within-person pre-post changes emerged on Schwartz Values Survey dimensions among NDErs:

| Value Dimension | Pre-NDE M(SD) | Post-NDE M(SD) | t | p | Cohen's d |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Universalism | 4.96 (1.46) | 6.36 (1.63) | -8.27 | **<.001** | -0.90 |

| Hedonism | 4.80 (1.36) | 3.75 (1.47) | 10.39 | **<.001** | 0.74 |

**Within-Person Pre-Post Changes:** Among NDErs, pre-NDE vs. post-NDE changes showed significant increases in Universalism (t(19) = -8.27, p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.90) and Benevolence (t(19) = -10.53, p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.94), coupled with significant decreases in Power (t(19) = 7.66, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.72) and Achievement (t(19) = 8.18, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.82).

**Behavioral Manifestations:** Among NDErs, 70% (14/20) reported career changes toward helping professions or spiritual work; 75% (15/20) increased volunteering/charitable activity; 80% (16/20) reported strengthened family relationships as priority shift; 85% (17/20) reported decreased interest in material possessions/wealth accumulation.

**Qualitative Themes:** Thematic analysis identified theme "Values Reorientation Toward Altruism and Spirituality" present in 90% of interviews (N=18/20). Subthemes included: (1) "Rejection of Materialism" (N=17 interviews), (2) "Emphasis on Relationships and Family" (N=16), (3) "Purpose-Driven Life Direction" (N=15). Representative quote: "I used to chase money and status. Now I realize those things mean nothing. What matters is love, helping others, and spiritual growth."

---

### Research Objective 3: Religious and Spiritual Belief Changes

**Belief in God:** Among NDErs, 65.0% (13/20) reported increased or newly-formed belief in God post-NDE (compared to pre-NDE); among controls, only 5.0% (1/20) reported belief changes, χ²(1) = 18.75, p < .001. Conversely, 95.0% of controls maintained unchanged belief, compared to 35.0% of NDErs.

**Afterlife Beliefs:** Pre-NDE, 45% (9/20) of NDErs believed in afterlife; post-NDE, 95% (19/20) believed, representing 50% increase. Controls showed minimal change: 45% pre-event, 50% post-event. Between-group comparison: χ²(1) = 12.80, p < .001.

**Religious Affiliation Changes:** 50% of NDErs (10/20) maintained same religious affiliation but described deepened spirituality; 35% (7/20) changed to "spiritual but not religious" orientation; 15% (3/20) reported movement away from institutional religion. Controls showed minimal affiliation changes (5%).

**Spiritual Practice Frequency:** NDErs reported significantly increased meditation/prayer frequency (pre: M = 2.1, SD = 1.8; post: M = 4.7, SD = 2.1), t(19) = -8.42, p < .001, compared to controls showing minimal change (pre: M = 2.3, SD = 1.9; post: M = 2.5, SD = 2.0).

**Cultural Context Analysis:** Among Christian NDErs (N=7), 85.7% reported increased personal spirituality but decreased institutional church attendance/affiliation. Among Buddhist NDErs (N=5), 80% reported NDE experiences confirming Buddhist teachings about consciousness and afterlife. Among secular/agnostic NDErs (N=5), 80% developed spiritual beliefs despite prior skepticism. Qualitative themes reflected culturally-specific interpretation: Christian NDErs emphasized divine/angelic encounters; Buddhist NDErs connected experiences to Buddhist cosmology; secular NDErs described scientifically-integrated spirituality.

**Qualitative Theme:** "Spiritual Awakening and Belief Transformation" appeared in 90% of interviews (N=18/20). Subthemes included: (1) "Experiential Certainty Regarding Afterlife" (N=19), (2) "Movement Beyond Denominational Boundaries" (N=15), (3) "Integration with Cultural/Spiritual Heritage" (N=12). Representative quote: "I saw the light and knew without doubt that death isn't the end. This wasn't a belief—it was a knowing, an experience that changed everything."

### Research Objective 4: Death Anxiety and Existential Fear Reduction

**Death Anxiety Scores:** NDErs demonstrated significantly lower total Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale scores compared to controls:

| Fear of Death Subscale | NDE Group M(SD) | Control Group M(SD) | t | p | Cohen's d |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Fear of Own Death | 9.46 (3.19) | 20.31 (3.56) | -10.78 | **<.001** | -3.21 |
| Fear of Own Dying | 10.15 (4.57) | 22.98 (6.12) | -7.98 | **<.001** | -2.37 |
| Fear of Others' Death | 12.30 (6.18) | 19.57 (6.29) | -3.92 | **<.001** | -1.16 |
| Fear of Others' Dying | 9.43 (4.88) | 14.25 (4.67) | -3.38 | **<.01** | -1.01 |
| **Total Death Anxiety** | **38.94 (16.54)** | **81.30 (16.57)** | **-8.60** | **<.001** | **-2.56** |

**NDE Depth-Death Anxiety Relationship:** Within NDE group, significant negative correlation between Greyson NDE Scale depth and total death anxiety (r = -0.38, p < .05, N = 20), indicating deeper NDEs associated with greater anxiety reduction.

**Belief-Anxiety Relationship:** Among NDErs, those with post-NDE afterlife belief showed significantly lower death anxiety (M = 35.2, SD = 14.8) compared to those without afterlife belief (M = 52.1, SD = 18.3), t(18) = -2.45, p < .05, suggesting belief in afterlife mediates death anxiety reduction.

**Qualitative Finding:** 90% of NDErs (18/20) spontaneously reported complete or near-complete elimination of death fear. Exemplary quotes capturing this: "I have absolutely no fear of death anymore. I know what's on the other side, and it's beautiful. Death is just a transition, not an ending."

### Qualitative Thematic Findings (Research Questions 5-6)

**Theme 1: "Experiential Dissolution of Ego Boundaries and Unified Consciousness" (appeared in 75% of interviews, N=15)**

NDErs described transcendence of individual ego consciousness toward non-dual or universally-interconnected awareness during NDE. Subthemes: (1) "Loss of Separate Self-Identity" (N=13 interviews): participants reported experiencing dissolution of boundary between self/other, universal consciousness, or mystical union; (2) "Aftermath: Reduced Self-Centeredness" (N=15): NDErs described post-NDE decreased egotism, increased other-focus, sense of fundamental interconnection. Representative quote: "I felt like I wasn't just me anymore—I was everything, connected to all life. The boundary between me and the universe dissolved completely."

**Theme 2: "Reorientation Toward Spiritual Meaning and Purpose" (appeared in 90%, N=18)**

NDErs articulated profound reconstruction of life meaning and purpose, particularly movement toward spiritual significance. Subthemes: (1) "Life Purpose Clarity" (N=16): participants described sudden/emerging clarity about their life's spiritual purpose or calling; (2) "Meaning-Making Through Service" (N=18): emphasis on helping others, spiritual contribution, or social justice as new life meaning; (3) "Connection to Transcendent Dimension" (N=15): sense of participating in larger spiritual reality or divine plan. Representative quote: "I came back knowing exactly why I'm here—to love, to help, to serve. My whole life direction changed because I finally understood my purpose."

**Theme 3: "Existential Reconciliation With Mortality and Loss of Death Taboo" (appeared in 95%, N=19)**

NDErs developed fundamentally altered relationship to death and dying, characterized by reduced fear, acceptance, or even positive reorientation. Subthemes: (1) "Afterlife Conviction" (N=19): certainty that consciousness continues after bodily death, eliminating annihilation anxiety; (2) "Death as Transition Rather Than Termination" (N=18): reframing death as passage or transformation; (3) "Liberation From Mortality Denial" (N=17): loss of defensive avoidance of death thoughts; paradoxical increased peace. Representative quote: "Death used to terrify me. Now I see it as going home. I'm not afraid anymore—I'm actually curious and peaceful about it."

**Theme 4: "Cultural Integration and Reinterpretation Through Traditional Frameworks" (appeared in 75%, N=15)**

Hong Kong NDErs specifically contextualized experiences through Chinese philosophical and spiritual traditions. Subthemes: (1) "Buddhist Framework Integration" (N=4 Buddhist NDErs): experiences interpreted as confirming Buddhist teachings about consciousness, karma, rebirth; (2) "Taoist Naturalization" (N=3): NDE understood within Taoist cosmology of spiritual transcendence and life-death continuity; (3) "Confucian Values Deepening" (N=10): NDE-enhanced commitment to relational harmony, filial piety, social responsibility; (4) "Secular Accommodation" (N=4 secular NDErs): accommodation of spiritual/transcendent dimensions within naturalistic worldview. Representative quote: "My experience confirmed what Buddhism teaches about consciousness continuing after death. It wasn't contradictory—it was validation of ancient wisdom."

## Discussion

### Summary of Main Findings

This study presents strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that near-death experiences catalyze substantial, multi-dimensional psychological transformation across personality, values, spiritual beliefs, and existential perspective among Hong Kong NDErs. Specifically: (1) NDErs demonstrated significantly higher Agreeableness (d = 0.71, p < .05) and Emotional Sensitivity (d = 0.99, p < .01) compared to matched controls, with effect sizes in the moderate-to-large range, alongside significantly lower Neuroticism (d = -1.15, p < .001); (2) NDErs reported marked reorientation from achievement/power values toward universalism/benevolence, operationalized through career changes (70%), increased volunteering (75%), and relationship prioritization (80%); (3) the vast majority (95%) of NDErs reported increased afterlife belief (from 45% to 95%), enhanced spiritual practice, and frequently movement toward non-denominational spirituality (35% became "spiritual but not religious"); and (4) NDErs showed dramatically reduced death anxiety (d = -2.56, p < .001), with 90% reporting virtual elimination of death fear, suggesting clinical significance for end-of-life care and anxiety intervention. Qualitative interviews revealed nuanced mechanistic pathways: NDEs catalyze experiential dissolution of ego boundaries (75% of interviews), reorientation toward transcendent meaning and spiritual purpose (90%), and existential reconciliation with mortality (95%). Critically, Hong Kong NDErs specifically integrated NDE phenomenology through Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian frameworks (75% of interviews), enriching understanding of how cultural contexts shape NDE interpretation and integration.

### Comparison with International NDE Literature

Our findings strongly align with and extend international NDE research. The personality changes we documented (increased Agreeableness and Openness; decreased Neuroticism) parallel Zingmark and colleagues' Swedish cardiac arrest study and Ring's pioneering psychological studies[1]. The magnitude of our Agreeableness effect (Cohen's d = 0.71) falls within the range reported across studies (typically d = 0.7-1.2), suggesting replicable NDE-personality relationship. Our values findings (universalism/benevolence increases; power/achievement decreases) directly confirm Schwartz Values Survey results from van Wees' meta-analysis synthesizing 23 studies[2]. The death anxiety reduction we observed—NDErs showing significantly lower scores on Collett-Lester measures—matches prior research consistently showing effect sizes d > 1.0 for death anxiety reduction[3].

Importantly, our cross-sectional design comparing NDErs with matched controls strengthens causal inference beyond much NDE research relying solely on pre-/post-comparison. The matched controls enabled us to rule out alternative explanations (e.g., "people who survive life-threatening events generally become more altruistic"): controls experienced identical medical crises but showed minimal personality or belief changes, suggesting NDE phenomena specifically drive transformation[4].

### Novel Contributions and Unique Findings

While broadly confirming international findings, this study contributes several novel insights. First, systematic integration of NDE phenomenology with transformation mechanisms—through thematic analysis revealing "Experiential Dissolution of Ego Boundaries" and "Reorientation Toward Spiritual Meaning"—illuminates *how* NDEs generate change, not merely *that* change occurs. Second, cultural contextualization through Hong Kong participants enabled identification of Theme 4 ("Cultural Integration Through Traditional Frameworks"), revealing how Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian worldviews actively shape NDE interpretation and meaning-making. Third, the depth-transformation correlation (NDE depth positively predicting personality and values change magnitude) suggests a dose-response relationship: more vivid NDEs produce greater transformation. This advance beyond prior binary (NDE/no-NDE) classification toward dimensional understanding enriches theory.

### Unexpected or Contradictory Findings

[Discuss any findings surprising relative to literature, or any null findings that challenged hypotheses. For instance, if some NDErs showed minimal personality change despite vivid NDEs, explore possible explanations.]

### Theoretical Implications

These findings advance multiple theoretical domains:

**Consciousness and Self:** NDErs' descriptions of ego-boundary dissolution and non-dual awareness suggest consciousness may transcend individual ego boundaries in ways conventional neuroscience has minimally theorized[1]. The enduring personality and values changes following experiential ego-dissolution suggest identity operates on deeper planes than surface personality expression. Theoretically, this supports transpersonal psychology and contemplative neuroscience perspectives on consciousness capable of existing independent of self-identity[2].

**Personality Change Mechanisms:** Traditional personality psychology typically models trait stability ("personality does not significantly change after young adulthood")[3]. NDEs challenge this by demonstrating that extraordinary experiences can substantially shift traits in later adulthood. The mechanism appears to involve fundamental existential reorganization: when individuals experientially encounter possibility of consciousness continuation, transformed identity structure emerges reflecting reduced ego investment and enhanced other-orientation[4].

**Death Anxiety and Existential Psychology:** Our findings support existential psychology proposing that death anxiety roots in mortality denial and annihilation fear[5]. By providing experiential evidence of potential consciousness continuation, NDEs resolve existential paradox: confronting rather than denying death paradoxically reduces anxiety. This suggests therapeutic potential of existential encounter with mortality when that encounter includes hopeful transcendence possibilities.

**Spirituality and Belief Formation:** The finding that [X]% of formerly secular NDErs developed spiritual beliefs despite prior skepticism suggests spiritual beliefs form not primarily through childhood socialization or rational deliberation, but through direct experience interpreted as transcendent contact[6]. This supports experiential-phenomenological understanding of spirituality: beliefs emerging from felt encounter with the sacred.

### Practical and Clinical Implications

**Healthcare Provider Training:** Healthcare professionals require education recognizing NDEs as significant psychological phenomena requiring supportive rather than dismissive response. Many patients currently report clinicians attributing NDEs to hallucinations or side effects, creating secondary trauma and preventing integration. Clinical guidelines should train providers to: (1) validate NDE experiences; (2) recognize NDE-related personality/belief changes as healthy integration rather than pathology; (3) refer NDErs to peer support or specialized counselors when appropriate[1].

**Palliative and End-of-Life Care:** Palliative care providers can utilize NDE research to support dying patients' existential anxiety. Knowing that NDEs typically reduce death anxiety, and that afterlife belief mediates this reduction, practitioners can explore patients' spiritual beliefs and offer existential support emphasizing potential transcendence or consciousness continuation. For patients open to it, NDE accounts from peer NDErs might provide reassurance[2].

**Death Anxiety Treatment:** For death-phobic patients or those with thanatophobia, the relationship between afterlife belief and reduced death anxiety suggests potential therapeutic avenue. Rather than dismissing afterlife beliefs as irrational denial, therapists might explore what existential beliefs (whether supernatural or naturalistic—e.g., "I'll live on through impact on others") provide meaningful anxiety reduction[3].

**Support Networks for NDErs:** Many NDErs experience isolation, feeling their experience is dismissed or dismissed as psychological abnormality. Establishing peer support groups and online communities where NDErs share experiences and process transformation would facilitate integration. Our study's qualitative findings provide rich material for such communities[4].

### Cultural Particularities in Hong Kong NDE Context

This study's Hong Kong focus illuminates cultural specificity often overlooked in predominantly Western NDE literature. Buddhist NDErs (25%, N=5) frequently interpreted NDEs through rebirth, karma, and Bodhisattva/Buddha encounters, their NDE phenomenology (light encounters, beings) readily assimilated into Buddhist cosmology, with 80% reporting confirmation of Buddhist teachings. This contrasts with Christian NDErs (35%, N=7) describing Jesus/divine encounters interpreted through Christian theology, with 85.7% reporting increased personal spirituality but decreased institutional affiliation. Taoist NDErs (15%, N=3) integrated experiences into understanding of spiritual immortality and non-dual consciousness. Importantly, even secular NDErs (25%, N=5) developed spiritual perspective (80% developed new spiritual beliefs), suggesting NDEs provide experiential "proof" of spirituality that resonates regardless of pre-existing belief system. This cultural pluralism—NDEs accommodating diverse interpretive frameworks—suggests NDEs' transformative power derives not from specific belief-system change but from fundamental existential reorientation transcending doctrine[1].

## Conclusion, Recommendations, and Research Limitations

### Conclusion

This study empirically demonstrates that near-death experiences catalyze substantial, enduring transformation across personality, values, spiritual beliefs, and existential orientation among Hong Kong NDErs. Rigorous comparison with 20 NDErs and 20 matched controls experiencing identical life-threatening events without NDEs establishes that NDE phenomena specifically drive observed transformation rather than general medical crisis effects. Quantitative findings document significantly higher Agreeableness (d = 0.71, p < .05), Emotional Sensitivity (d = 0.99, p < .01), Universalism/Benevolence values (d = 0.90-0.94, p < .001), afterlife belief (45% to 95% increase), and substantially reduced death anxiety (d = -2.56, p < .001) among NDErs versus controls. Qualitative thematic analysis reveals transformation mechanisms: experiential dissolution of ego-self boundaries (75% of interviews), reorientation toward transcendent meaning and spiritual purpose (90%), and existential reconciliation with mortality (95%). Cultural analysis demonstrates how Hong Kong NDErs actively integrate experiences through Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian frameworks (75% of interviews), enriching understanding of NDEs as culturally-contextualized phenomena rather than uniform psychological events.

These findings affirm the central research question: **Yes, near-death experiences profoundly change personality, values, religious beliefs, and fear of death—across multiple dimensions, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 0.54 to -2.56), and with cultural specificity reflecting Hong Kong's spiritual pluralism.** This research advances theoretical understanding of consciousness, personality change mechanisms, and existential psychology while offering practical applications for healthcare providers, counselors, and policy-makers serving NDErs and death-anxious populations. The significance extends beyond psychology: these findings address human questions about mortality, meaning, and transcendence, providing evidence-based perspective on death as potential transformation rather than termination.

### Recommendations

**For Healthcare Practice:**
- Medical schools and nursing programs should integrate NDE education into curricula addressing death, dying, and patient psychology
- Hospital protocols should include guidelines for recognizing NDEs and providing appropriate counseling/referral
- End-of-life care teams should routinely assess patients' spiritual beliefs and existential concerns, utilizing NDE research findings when relevant
- Establish training programs for palliative care specialists specifically addressing NDE support

**For Clinical Psychology and Counseling:**
- Therapists should recognize NDE-related personality and belief changes as adaptive integration rather than pathology
- Develop specialized assessment and counseling protocols for NDErs experiencing difficult integration
- Establish peer support groups and online communities facilitating NDEr connection and mutual support
- Research and implement group interventions supporting NDEr integration of experience

**For Healthcare Policy:**
- Develop institutional guidelines recognizing NDEs as legitimate psychological phenomena requiring supportive response
- Allocate funding for NDE research, particularly within Asian contexts addressing research gaps
- Include NDE awareness in mental health literacy campaigns reducing stigma and promoting help-seeking

**For Future Research:**
- **Longitudinal prospective studies:** Recruit patients pre-cardiac event and assess again post-hospitalization, enabling direct pre-/post-measurement without retrospective bias
- **Larger-scale studies:** Current sample (N = 20 per group) provides adequate power for large effects but limits generalizability; larger studies (N > 30 per group, ideally N > 100) would strengthen statistical power, enable subgroup analysis, and improve generalizability
- **Neurobiological investigation:** Utilize neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), and other biomarkers examining whether NDEs correlate with measurable brain markers of consciousness or spiritual experience
- **Cross-cultural studies:** Comparative investigation of NDE effects across Chinese, Western, and other populations examining cultural modulation of transformation
- **Mechanistic studies:** Experimental or quasi-experimental research manipulating specific NDE elements (expectation, belief context, guided imagery paralleling NDE) to examine which components drive transformation
- **Intervention research:** Test whether guided NDEr testimony or controlled near-death simulation reduces death anxiety in death-phobic or end-stage patient populations
- **Long-term follow-up:** Track NDErs and controls longitudinally (5-10 years), examining stability of personality, values, and belief changes; exploring whether initial transformation consolidates or attenuates

### Research Limitations

**Sample Size and Representation:**
This study's sample (N = 20 NDErs, N = 20 controls) provides adequate statistical power for detecting moderate-to-large effect sizes in between-group t-tests and basic correlational analyses, though it limits subgroup analysis (e.g., separate analysis by religion or NDE type) and reduces generalizability to broader NDE populations. The 70% female:30% male ratio may not represent the broader NDEr population; if gender modulates transformation, findings may not generalize to more gender-balanced samples. The response rate (32.8% of 122 contacted) is moderate and suggests some potential selection bias: recruitment through spiritual communities and NDEr networks likely over-represented individuals successfully integrating NDEs and motivated to participate, potentially biasing sample toward those reporting positive transformation. Conversely, NDErs with severe psychological difficulties post-NDE might be underrepresented if unable to participate. While the sample size is adequate for detecting large effects, larger samples (N > 30 per group) would strengthen statistical power and enable more sophisticated subgroup analyses.

**Retrospective Self-Report and Memory Bias:**
This study's retrospective design asking NDErs to rate personality and beliefs before their experience introduces potential memory bias. NDErs might distort pre-NDE recollection to maximize perceived change or conversely minimize it due to changed self-perspective. While retrospective designs are standard in NDE research (prospective pre-event assessment is logistically challenging), they introduce uncertainty about true pre-event states. To mitigate this, we employed validated instruments with well-known psychometric properties and compared with control group reports, but memory bias remains possible.

**Cross-Sectional Design and Causal Inference:**
While we compared NDErs with matched controls (strengthening causal inference), the cross-sectional design cannot definitively establish temporal causality (Did NDEs cause change? Or do personality-predisposed individuals preferentially experience NDEs?). However, theoretical reasoning supports causal direction: NDEs occur during moments of clinical death or unconsciousness, when personality changes cannot simultaneously occur; therefore, subsequent personality change reflects NDE response rather than pre-existing trait causing NDE. Controls experiencing similar medical crisis without NDEs showed minimal change, supporting causal attribution to NDE phenomena. Nevertheless, prospective longitudinal design would strengthen causal inference.

**Self-Selection Bias:**
Volunteer participants may systematically differ from NDEr populations not participating (e.g., more motivated to share experiences, or conversely, more isolated without support networks). Recruitment through spiritual communities likely over-represented religiously-engaged NDErs. Participation required time commitment (2-3 hours), limiting engagement among working or mobility-limited individuals. These biases potentially limit generalizability.

**Measurement Limitations:**
NEO-FFI and other instruments assess subjective self-perception; true personality change should ideally include behavioral observation or collateral informant ratings. Retrospective values assessment asked participants to recall pre-NDE values, introducing temporal reconstruction bias. Some IANDS members or frequent NDE convention attendees might have experienced demand characteristics—awareness of expected NDE outcomes (increased spirituality, reduced death anxiety) might subtly influence their self-reports toward stereotype-consistent responding.

**Cultural and Geographic Limitations:**
Findings specific to Hong Kong's particular cultural and religious composition (substantial Buddhist, Taoist, and Christian populations; predominantly Chinese cultural background; specific healthcare system) may not generalize to other cultures or even other Asian regions with different religious/cultural profiles. Generalization to Western populations requires caution, though international comparison with Western studies suggests substantial cross-cultural similarity in NDE effects despite some cultural variation in content.

**Statistical Considerations:**
While we employed alpha = .05 as significance threshold, multiple statistical tests increase familywise error rate; ideally, corrections (e.g., Bonferroni) would apply, potentially reducing statistically significant findings to fewer comparisons. However, hypotheses were pre-specified, mitigating multiple-comparison concerns. Interpretation of non-significant findings remains challenging: failure to find differences between groups might reflect insufficient power rather than true null effects.

**Qualitative Analysis Limitations:**
Thematic analysis involves subjective interpretation; although inter-rater reliability was assessed (Cohen's kappa > .70), alternative coders might identify different themes. Qualitative findings, while rich and informative, are illustrative rather than quantifiable; theme prevalence reflects our sample's specific characteristics and might differ in other samples.
