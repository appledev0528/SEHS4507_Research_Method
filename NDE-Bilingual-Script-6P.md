## Speaker 1 演讲者一：开场与定义 | Opening & Definition

[translate:大家好，欢迎光临我们的濒死体验与心理转变研究演讲。我是（名字），将与五位同学为大家介绍本港团队的实证研究。]
Good [morning/afternoon], and welcome to our presentation on near-death experiences and psychological transformation. I am (Name), joined by five colleagues to share our empirical research conducted in Hong Kong.

[translate:我们研究的起点是一个重要问题：当一个人经历濒临死亡时，他/她的生命会有什么变化？这个问题不仅哲学化，更是科学化。]
Our starting point is an important question: When someone faces a near-death experience, how does their life change? This is not only a philosophical issue, but also a scientific one.

[translate:首先，什么是濒死体验？]
First, what is a near-death experience?

[translate:濒死体验指人在面临生死危机时经历的极为深刻的心理和感知现象，通常包含：]
A near-death experience refers to the profound psychological and perceptual events experienced during a life-threatening crisis, usually involving:
- [translate:灵魂出窍感]   | Out-of-body sensations
- [translate:隧道与光]     | Tunnels and light
- [translate:人生回顾]     | Life review
- [translate:灵性觉知]     | Spiritual awareness

[translate:全球约4至15%的人报告有类似体验。]
Worldwide, around 4-15% of people report similar experiences.

## Speaker 2 演讲者二：香港研究意义 | Significance in Hong Kong

[translate:那么，为什么要在香港研究濒死体验？]
So, why study NDEs in Hong Kong?

[translate:原因有三：第一，知识空白。国际大部分研究集中在西方。亚洲—特别是华语圈—还极少系统探讨濒死体验。我们想知道，香港是否有独特的表现？]
Three main reasons: First, a knowledge gap. Most international research is Western-focused. Asia—especially the Chinese-speaking world—rarely systematically explores NDEs. We wanted to know if Hong Kong has unique characteristics.

[translate:第二，文化多元。香港的宗教背景多样，包括佛教（35.4%）、基督教（27.1%）、道教（20.8%）和世俗人口（16.7%），适合对比分析。]
Second, cultural diversity. Hong Kong's religious landscape is diverse: Buddhist (35.4%), Christian (27.1%), Taoist (20.8%), and secular (16.7%), making it ideal for comparative analysis.

[translate:第三，实际意义。医生和护理专业常常忽略濒死体验的心理转变，这影响患者康复。我们研究目的之一，是推动医疗服务认知转变。]
Third, practical significance. Medical and nursing professionals often overlook the psychological transformation of NDEs, affecting patient recovery. One of our goals is to promote attitudinal change in healthcare.

[translate:这正是我们的研究计划切入点。]
This is where our research comes in.

## Speaker 3 演讲者三：方法与样本 | Methods & Sample

[translate:我们采用混合方法研究：定量和定性结合。]
We adopted a mixed-methods design: combining quantitative and qualitative approaches.

[translate:定量部分招募了30位经历濒死体验的香港居民，均有真实临床危机纪录。主要测量工具：]
The quantitative part recruited 30 Hong Kong NDErs, all with documented clinical crises. Main instruments included:
- NEO五因素人格问卷 (NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory)
- [translate:施瓦茨价值观量表] (Schwartz Values Survey)
- [translate:科莱特-莱斯特死亡恐惧量表] (Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale)

[translate:我们还与国际发表数据进行比较，样本性别、年龄、宗教多元，平均NDE发生时间8.2年。]
We compared our findings with international published data. The sample was diverse in gender, age, and religion, with an average elapsed time of 8.2 years since the NDE.

[translate:定性分析部分有三位访谈对象，分别代表佛教、基督教、世俗信仰背景。]
The qualitative analysis involved three interviewees, representing Buddhist, Christian, and secular backgrounds.

## Speaker 4 演讲者四：主要量化与质性发现 | Key Findings

[translate:数据十分突出。]
The data is striking.

[translate:第一，濒死体验者同理心和宜人性明显高于对照组（43.8 vs 38.4），说明他们变得更关心别人。]
First, NDErs scored much higher on empathy and agreeableness compared to controls (43.8 vs 38.4), showing they became more caring.

[translate:第二，76.7%报告价值观转向普世关怀，80%物质取向减少，大量人转职业至助人工作。]
Second, 76.7% reported a values shift toward universal compassion, 80% reduced material orientation, and many changed to helping professions.

[translate:第三，信仰转变显著。原本只有46.7%相信死后生命，NDE后达90%。多数佛教者联系体验与业力、轮回，世俗者也转向灵性和意义。]
Third, shifts in beliefs were significant. Originally only 46.7% believed in an afterlife; post-NDE, this rose to 90%. Most Buddhists interpreted the experience through karma and rebirth, seculars turned to spirituality and meaning.

[translate:最后，死亡焦虑大幅下降。平均分42.3 vs 对照组79.4，93.3%几无死亡恐惧。]
Finally, death anxiety dropped dramatically: average score 42.3 vs. controls at 79.4; 93.3% reported almost no fear of death.

## Speaker 5 演讲者五：真实故事 | Real Stories

[translate:我们听到了三位当事人的真情分享。]
We heard the heartfelt shares from three NDErs.

[translate:第一位是一位58岁的佛教女性，溺水后体验自我与宇宙融合。现在，她是冥想老师，死亡已无恐惧。]
The first was a 58-year-old Buddhist woman who, after a near-drowning, experienced union with the universe. She is now a meditation instructor, no longer fearing death.

[translate:第二位是一位64岁的基督徒男性，心脏骤停后体验“无条件的爱”，从商进入临终关怀志愿服务。]
The second was a 64-year-old Christian man who, after cardiac arrest, experienced "unconditional love," shifting from business to hospice volunteering.

[translate:第三位是46岁的世俗女性，创伤后体验“纯粹意识”，不信教却相信意识继续存在，现从事非牟利法律工作。]
The third was a 46-year-old secular woman who, after trauma, experienced "pure consciousness," isn't religious but now believes consciousness persists, working in the nonprofit legal sector.

[translate:三人共同点：同理心大增，人生重心由物质成就转向意义服务，对死亡彻底释怀。]
The common ground: all three showed increased empathy, shifted life focus from material achievement to meaning and service, and reached complete acceptance of death.

## Speaker 6 演讲者六：结论与展望 | Conclusion & Outlook

[translate:我们的研究揭示，濒死体验是一种强大的心理转折点。它带来真实、可衡量的性格、价值和信仰转变，普遍降低死亡焦虑。]
Our study reveals that NDEs are a powerful psychological turning point, leading to real, measurable changes in personality, values, and beliefs, universally lowering death anxiety.

[translate:这种转变不仅跨文化普遍存在，也是医疗服务需要重视的现象。医生、护理人员应以开放和支持的态度理解NDE。]
This transformation is universal across cultures and should be taken seriously in healthcare. Doctors and nurses should approach NDEs with openness and support.

[translate:未来研究建议包括更大样本的追踪研究、跨亚洲比较，以及机制探索。濒死体验不仅关乎个人成长，也是医学与心理学继续探索的重要领域。]
Future research should include larger longitudinal samples, cross-Asia comparisons, and deeper mechanism studies. NDEs are not only about personal growth but are important for ongoing medical and psychological exploration.

[translate:最后，感谢大家的聆听，欢迎提问。]
Finally, thank you for your attention, and we welcome your questions.
