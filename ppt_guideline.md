- Course: SEHS4507 Research Methodology in Applied Sciences  
- Group members & student IDs  
- Presentation date  

Tip (from Lecture 9 – “Cover Page”): include project title, for whom prepared, researcher names, and date.

---

3. Objectives & Questions  
4. Significance  
5. Methodology  
6. Findings  
7. Discussion

---

## Slide 3. Background / Introduction
- Brief introduction to NDE phenomenon  
- Why study NDE (interest → contribution to psychology/spiritual studies)  
- Show a visual (timeline or infographic on NDE research growth)  
- Highlight research gap: “Most prior work = medical/physiological; few examine value/personality change”

(Lecture 1 – “What is Research”, Lecture 2 – “Choosing Topic & Gap Identification”)

---

## Slide 4. Problem Statement & Knowledge Gap
- Specific gap: few Asian/young adult studies  
- Need for mixed method approach  
- Quote from previous study illustrating limitation

---

## Slide 5. Literature Review – Existing Findings
- Key theories/authors: Greyson (1983), Ring (1980), Moody (1975)  
- Common findings: greater compassion, lower death anxiety, increased spirituality  
- Graphical summary/table: themes → measurement methods → samples  
- Identify inconsistencies: “Some studies report no personality change”

---

## Slide 6. Literature Review – Conceptual Framework
- Diagram (based on Lecture 2): NDE → (personality/value/religious belief change) → fear of death  
- Variables:  
  - Independent Variable: experience of NDE  
  - Dependent Variables: personality, values, beliefs, death fear  
- Arrows show predicted relationships

---

## Slide 7. Research Objectives & Questions
- Objective 1: Investigate relationship between NDE and personality/value change  
- Objective 2: Assess impact of NDE on religious belief and fear of death  
- Research Questions: RQ1–RQ3 (bullet points)  
- Optional Hypotheses: H₁, H₂ (summary)

---

## Slide 8. Significance / Contribution
- Academic value: fills context gap (Asian sample / mixed methods)  
- Practical value: insights for counselors and spiritual advisors  
- Social impact: promotes death anxiety awareness and mental health policy

(Linked to Lecture 1 & 2 — “Why Study Research” and “Social Benefit”)

---

## Slide 9. Research Design Overview
- Flow: Literature → Design → Data Collection → Analysis → Findings  
- Mixed Methods = Qualitative + Quantitative  
- Timeline (Weeks 1 to 12)

---

## Slide 10. Sampling
- Target population: Adults with documented/claimed NDE  
- Sampling method: Snowball Sampling (Lecture 7)  
- Expected sample size ≈ 20–30 quantitative + 5–8 interviewees  
- Inclusion criteria & ethical considerations

---

## Slide 11. Data Collection Methods
- Questionnaire (Likert Scale) examples:  
  - “I no longer fear death.” (1–5)  
  - “I feel more connected to a spiritual force.” (1–5)  
- Semi‑Structured Interview Questions:  
  - “Describe your NDE and what changed afterwards.”  
- Show sample questions in table format

Refer to Lecture 6 – Questionnaire Design Principles (simple language, avoid double‑barrelled questions).

---

## Slide 12. Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent & voluntary participation  
- Anonymity and confidentiality measures  
- Emotional sensitivity when discussing death experience  
- Compliance with university research ethics policies

(Lecture 2B – Research Ethics)

---

## Slide 13. Data Analysis
- Quantitative: SPSS → Descriptive stats (mean, SD) + Cross‑tab tests  
- Qualitative: Thematic Analysis → 3 themes: awakening, value shift, reduced fear  
- Show example quotes from participants

(Lecture 8 & 9 – Data Analysis, Experiments, Validity)

---

## Slide 14. Key Findings – Summary Graph
- Bar chart: % reporting “less fear of death”  
- Pie chart: religious belief change distribution  
- Quote banner: representative interview excerpt

---

## Slide 15. Discussion – Interpretation
- Compare with literature (Greyson & Ring: similar spiritual growth)  
- Possible mechanisms: psychological post‑traumatic growth (PTG)  
- Mention limitations (sampling, recall bias)

---

## Slide 16. Conclusion
- Restate central finding: NDE appears to trigger positive value and belief shifts and reduce death fear  
- Highlight social and clinical implications

---

## Slide 17. Recommendations
- For future research: larger cross‑cultural samples, longitudinal designs  
- For practitioners: integrate NDE‑related themes into therapy

---

## Slide 18. Limitations
- Small sample size  
- Non‑random sampling  
- Possible memory bias and social desirability effect

---

## Slide 19. References (APA Format)
- Use APA 7th style (Lecture 4A)  
- Example entries:  
  - Greyson (2014) After…  
  - Ring (1980) Life at Death  
  - Moody (1975) Life After Life

---

## Slide 20. Thank You / Q&A
- “Thank you for listening. We welcome your questions.”  
- Include team photo or logos (optional)

---

# 💡 Design & Delivery Tips
- Visual balance: 1 main idea per slide; use charts for data  
- Consistency: font size ≥ 24 pt; use APA‑style citation on slides  
- Transitions: each speaker introduces the next (“Now my teammate will explain our methodology...”)  
- Practice: rehearse timing to leave buffer for Q&A
